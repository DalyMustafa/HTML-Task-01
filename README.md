# HTML-Task-Beginners
In this task, you will be practicing HTML using some of its basic tags.

### Instructions
- Fork and clone this repository
- cd into the `HTML-beginners` folder.
- Create a file called `index.html`.
- Create a **stunning** web page of you choice(you can talk about yourself, or any favorite things) using:
     - `h1` tag.
     - `p` tag.
     - `ordered list` tag.
     - `unordered` tag.
     - `img` tag.
     - `unordered` tag.

### Tips
- Everything you want to be displayed on the screen, should be within the `body` tag.
- Be carful with the opening and closing tags. If you accidentally erase a “<” or the “/” it may make the page render funny. You have to be very precise with your typing.
- HTML doesn’t work the same as a typical text editor like Microsoft Word or Apple Pages or Google Docs. If you press the “Return” button on your keyboard to get a new line, the web browser won’t do as you expect. If you’d like to add a new line after a sentence, you will need to use a line break tag. <br>
